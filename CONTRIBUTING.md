## How to contribute

If you are new to Github, [start here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

1. Please consider opening an issue and allowing some discussion before making any changes.
2. Please do not send pull requests from your fork's master branch. It will be easier for both parties to create a feature branch and send your PR from there.
3. Keep the number of commits per PR down and keep the commit messages relevant.
4. Please try to add a good description of changes you are making. Screenshots are really helpful if there are any visual changes.
